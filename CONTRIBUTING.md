# Contributing

We welcome your contributions! There are multiple ways to contribute.

## Opening issues

For bugs or enhancement requests, please file a GitHub issue unless it's
security related. When filing a bug remember that the better written the bug is,
the more likely it is to be fixed. If you think you've found a security
vulnerability, do not raise a GitHub issue and follow the instructions in our
[security policy](./SECURITY.md).

## Contributing code

We welcome your code contributions. Before submitting code via a pull request,
you will need to have signed the [Oracle Contributor Agreement][OCA] (OCA) and
your commits need to include the following line using the name and e-mail
address you used to sign the OCA:

```text
Signed-off-by: Your Name <you@example.org>
```

This can be automatically added to pull requests by committing with `--sign-off`
or `-s`, e.g.

```text
git commit --signoff
```

Only pull requests from committers that can be verified as having signed the OCA
can be accepted.

## Pull request process

1. Ensure there is an issue created to track and discuss the fix or enhancement
   you intend to submit.
2. Fork this repository.
3. Create a branch in your fork to implement the changes. We recommend using the issue number as 
part of your branch name, e.g. `1234-fixes`.Ensure that any documentation is updated with the changes.
1. Add a test for the new behaviour (or that exercises the bug if a bug fix).
1. Submit the pull request. *Do not leave the pull request text blank*. 
Explain exactly what your changes are meant to do and provide simple steps on how to validate your 
changes. 
Ensure that you reference the issue you created as well. 
The PR name will be the name of the squashed commit to main.
1. We will assign the pull request to be reviewed before it is merged.
